About this project
==================
This is an FTP honeypot server

## Why I create this project?
Because I want to be able to steal FTP passwords(legally of course!) without having to download additional packages.

I should just be able to get reverse-shell, set up a listener on my target machine and execute my script.

But, when googling FTP honeypots, All of the ones I could easily find had external dependencies that made them impossible to use for stuff like HTB, and forced the target machine to essentially reach out, or install additional packages.

Well, I fixed that issue.

## Dependencies
None. The upstream repository created a client for this, and it originally was just a FTP server.
